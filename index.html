      <p>Lebowski ipsum hello! Do you speak English? Parla usted Inglese? I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug? DWalter, this isn't a First Amendment thing. Look, Larry… Have you ever heard of Vietnam? No, look. I do mind. The Dude minds. This will not stand, you know, this aggression will not stand, man.And so, Theodore Donald Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well. I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that. It's good knowin' he's out there, the Dude, takin' her easy for all us sinners. Shit. I sure hope he makes The finals. Welp, that about does her, wraps her all up. Things seem to've worked out pretty good for the Dude'n Walter, and it was a purt good story, dontcha think? Made me laugh to beat the band. Parts, anyway. Course—I didn't like seein' Donny go. But then, happen to know that there's a little Lebowski on the way. I guess that's the way the whole durned human comedy keeps perpetuatin' itself, down through the generations, westward the wagons, across the sands a time until— aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' again. Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed yourselves.</p>

    <h2>Something about Doughnuts</h2>

        <p>We know it's his fucking homework, Walter! Where's the fucking money, you little brat? Dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Does the Pope shit in the woods? Praesent ac magna justo pellentesque ac. I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski. Lectus quis elit blandit fringilla a ut turpis praesent. No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. Felis ligula, malesuada suscipit malesuada non.

It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins. Lotta outs. And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man. Ultrices non urna sed orci ipsum, placerat id condimentum rutrum, rhoncus ac lorem. Our basic freedoms. Aliquam placerat posuere neque, at dignissim magna ullamcorper in aliquam. I like your style, Dude. Sagittis massa ac tortor ultrices faucibus. Yeah man. Well, you know, the Dude abides. Curabitur eu mi sapien, ut ultricies ipsum morbi eget.</p>

    <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be?

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
