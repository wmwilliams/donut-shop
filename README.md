Week 2 bootcamp assignment


for the css styling so far...
I picked a font fron new font from google fonts called Alegreya and decided to use that for the main heading. The rest of the fonts are a more normal georgia times serif.

From adobe color i picked out a theme that I thought that i liked called Stay in Bef. Once I put it on my page I really didnt like it though so I will change that in the future.

Also I want to beef up the menu, and make it a little more substantial.
